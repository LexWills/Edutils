# What Is This?

This is a free repository of general-use code.

The code is comprised of functions that perform small, very specific tasks, showing you how to do things like:
- Smooth a float value between 0 and 1.
- Rotate a Vector in 2D/3D space.
- Convert to and from polar coordinates.
- Perform trigonometric functions.
- Describe intervals of time.
- Camel/Pascal case strings.
- etc

Each function solves a specific, but often occurring coding problem, providing the most efficient solution possible. The code is throughly tested and exhaustively documented, with examples and explanations of every function and concept.

The goal is to help other programmers with coding problem's I've had in the past, showing them the formulas and techniques I've developed for solving these tricky, often occurring coding problems.

# Language

Everything is written in CSharp (C#), some code specifically developed for [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). However, every concept is heavily documented and explains, allowing you to transpose the logic/formulas used into any language.
